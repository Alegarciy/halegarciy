# Github Profile

## Motives

I want to be able to make my Github page profile better looking, have a nice feel when people investigate my profile and projects. I want it to feel elegant and minimalistic, without too much overhead you have to go through. I watched a couple of profiles that implemented this ideas and I liked the approach enough to wanting to do it.

## References & Observations

## Project Development

This is a project that won't take more than 2 weeks, so the t-shirt size I would say feels like a XS. I notice that the `README.md` files could be scripted and filled with information on them by creating cron jobs of actions or even trigger actions inside Github. That means there is a lot of programmability you can add to your profile, that will extend the profile view from a basic markup project to a bigger project to showcase your creativity. (This was discovered specifically in the Simon Willison's article).
