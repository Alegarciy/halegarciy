      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;sebastian-ramirez---the-creator-of-fastapi&#34;&gt;Sebastian Ramirez - the creator of FastAPI&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;motives&#34;&gt;Motives&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This week at work we were planning to create a feature for a Python API for our event ingestions from different micro-service architecture. Given the option there was an idea to develop the back-end in Flask or other frameworks but a new framework was suggested that is called FastAPI. Then for some reason, the lead of the team proposed the migration without considering before the option (that is really bad) and a new member suggested we try out the FastAPI alternative because is more maintained at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;zettlekasten-note-taking-system-first-approach-and-review&#34;&gt;Zettlekasten note taking system: First approach and review.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-the-idea-of-note-taking-was-conceived&#34;&gt;How the idea of note taking was conceived&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At first, I started taking notes on paper since 2023 in an informal manner. I noticed that I became dependent on them, more so than I expected at first always searching for notes i didn&amp;rsquo;t record and learnings I must have forgotten because of my long-term retention capacity. Finally this year (2024), I decided to commit myself to have a formal approach on note taking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-blog-experience&#34;&gt;First blog experience&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that sharing knowledge is something I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to do, no matter if its with my school friends, at work or on the internet through forums and disguise as another funny looking profile with a funny sounding name. I think that everyone is a bucket full of ideas waiting to be spilled and enjoyed by others like myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to dedicate this block to all those good ideas that I need to share, and for those who were around and manage to inspire me, for non of them are only mine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
