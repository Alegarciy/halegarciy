  How the idea of note taking was conceived
  #

At first, I started taking notes on paper since 2023 in an informal manner. I noticed that I became dependent on them, more so than I expected at first always searching for notes i didn&rsquo;t record and learnings I must have forgotten because of my long-term retention capacity. Finally this year (2024), I decided to commit myself to have a formal approach on note taking.">

</h2>
<p>At first, I started taking notes on paper since 2023 in an informal manner. I noticed that I became dependent on them, more so than I expected at first always searching for notes i didn&rsquo;t record and learnings I must have forgotten because of my long-term retention capacity. Finally this year (2024), I decided to commit myself to have a formal approach on note taking.</p>
<p>As I was searching for references on my investigation, a nice reference was found of a particular devops self-thought man previously a nurse and out of passion of being a &ldquo;knowledge worker&rdquo; became a developer operations engineer. This man&rsquo;s name is <a href="https://mischavandenburg.com/">&ldquo;Mischa van den Burg&rdquo;</a>. He has a zettlekasten system on his own, and I decided to follow his steps and set up my own based in some of the features he developed.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-some-tools">
  Choosing some tools
  <a class="anchor" href="#choosing-some-tools">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I found myself always craving for <code>frictionless feature</code>, even for note taking. A <code>frictionless feature</code> is a tool, routine or any sort of idea that makes my life easier without putting a lot of effort on learning the habit of it. It should feel like it was always required and when you manage to do it; it should feel like it always was there.</p>
<p>For me, a <code>frictionless feature</code> at first was the white paper approach. The mental effort for <em>recording new findings</em> and information is non existent and is flexibility is impressive (adding color pencils feels great!). But the white paper approach really lacked in the <em>recovering mechanism</em>. For this same reason I manage to create a better automatized approach using Neovim fuzzy finder features + Obsidian&rsquo;s graph viewer.</p>
<p>Neovim is a great IDE for development mostly but can be configure to search between notes and making great experience for writing code. Since I have a developer background I decided to create a &ldquo;Neovim note taking system&rdquo; approach based on what Mischa van den Burg suggested himself. Obsidian was a note taking system that has interesting graphical plugins and visualizations, that will provide more aesthetic note visualizations.</p>

  Removing friction for the note taking system
  <a class="anchor" href="#removing-friction-for-the-note-taking-system">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Once I had figured out which tools would be useful for the system, I had to reduce as much friction as possible. <code>Friction</code> for me, is the antagonist of proactivity. Reducing effort contributes to creating action, by facilitating the person to not stall through tedious routines.</p>
<p>A easy technical solution for reducing the undesirable friction was to create a serious of small automatization around the interaction specifically of creating notes. The biggest gap I thought needed to be attended as soon as possible was the <em>recording new findings</em> mechanism. Opening an application is a major friction point for me as a user, so creating a <code>shortcut</code> for it that will create a note structure with an specific <code>unique identifier</code> per note is valuable.</p>
<p>As a solution, I manage to investigate a proper automatized small system with <code>bash files</code>. For this system, my  previous experience had thought me that many bash files tend to entropy real quick. Given that a good solution, most be maintainable and understandable for a long time, I decided to create a personal folder for all <code>dotfiles</code> solution. A dotfile based on what is posted on <a href="https://github.com/topics/dotfiles?o=desc&amp;s=updated">Github dotfile topic</a> it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Legend goes, that dotfiles were invented when ls used to skip files and directories starting with a . (dot). As a result, files that begin with such a character were not shown when listing using ls â€” i.e. it was a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; file. Since dotfiles are ususually user-specific, a predestined place for them is the $HOME directory. Commonly used files are for example: <code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.zshrc</code> or <code>.vimrc</code>.</p>

<p>Taking notes is to live with intention - Mischa van den Burg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a forgetful person, and I am in a moment in my life were ideas are a big part of me. This quote above, resonated with how i felt for the longest time, forgetting was a painful act in itself since valuable thoughts you cherish suddenly banish and you don&rsquo;t notice them when they go away. I want to record thoughts, they don&rsquo;t need to have an specific structure or make much sense but I want to be the craftsman of my empire of ideas.</p>

<p>For the PARA methods, it is a simple note taking system, that creates a couple of concepts around how files should be ordered into a limited categories of folders. This folder are the (P)rojects, (A)reas, (R)esources, (A)rchives. Each of them has a use:</p>

<li>
<p>Projects: &ldquo;A project is a sequence of tasks you need to accomplish in order to achieve a certain outcome - David Allan&rdquo; (3 months - 12 months)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Areas: It involves ongoing engagements. It places a particular important role in your life. Are areas particularly important to your life like health, sports, family, &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources: Is a collection of information, that you expect to be useful. It can be hobbies, investigations, interests, &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Archive: Searching for notes, old notes will appear and you make connections. This is information can be logged as &ldquo;old&rdquo;, but could appear on a search for a helping hand some day.</p>
</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A log started life as a lump of wood such as you might throw on a fire. And it still is - sometimes. When sailors wanted to know how fast they were going, they would throw over the stern a log tied to a bit of string with regularly spaced knots in it. By counting the number of knots that went out in a fixed time, they would know their speed - in knots, of course. A navigator would want to have a regular record of this speed, so that he could calculate how fast the ship was travelling than thus roughly where he was. So the speed was written down, initially on a slate but later in a book, which, since it recorded the log measurements, was called the log. - By <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-are-computer-logfiles-called-so">Alec Cawley</a></p>
