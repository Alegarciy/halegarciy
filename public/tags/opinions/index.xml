 First blog experience
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#first-blog-experience">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I think that sharing knowledge is something I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to do, no matter if its with my school friends, at work or on the internet through forums and disguise as another funny looking profile with a funny sounding name. I think that everyone is a bucket full of ideas waiting to be spilled and enjoyed by others like myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would like to dedicate this block to all those good ideas that I need to share, and for those who were around and manage to inspire me, for non of them are only mine.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
