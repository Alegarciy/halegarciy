      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;updated1--first-blog-experience&#34;&gt;Updated1- First blog experience&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that sharing knowledge is something I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to do, no matter if its with my school friends, at work or on the internet through forums and disguise as another funny looking profile with a funny sounding name. I think that everyone is a bucket full of ideas waiting to be spilled and enjoyed by others like myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to dedicate this block to all those good ideas that I need to share, and for those who were around and manage to inspire me, for non of them are only mine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
